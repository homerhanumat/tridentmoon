This article lists the postures of the Primary Series as taught by BNS Iyngar, along with a rendering of the encompassing vinyāsa.[^vinyasa] The postures are identified first in Sanskrit and then in English translation.

[^vinyasa]: The term *vinyāsa* is often used loosely to refer to the sequence of movments that form a transition from one seated posture to the next---liftng up, jumping/stepping back to plank, up-dog, down-down, jump/step through to a sitting position to begin the next posture---but here it is used in its strict sense as one-half of a breath (either the inhale or the exhale) that is to be associated with a particular movement between postures as opposed to breaths taken while in the postures themselves.

    Both the loose and strict sense of the term appear to have been introduced in the 20th century, probably by Tirumalai Kṛśṇamācharya, the developer of Aṣṭāṅga Yoga.  See <a href="https://www.theluminescent.org/2016/07/vinyasa-medieval-and-modern-meanings.html" target="_blank">this article</a> for more information on the term.]

It is important to bear in mind that, just as the postures themselves should be modified to individual bodies and needs, so the encompassing vinyāsa count should treated as aspirational only and should be subject to adjustment.  Even experienced persons who come to the practice with considerable bodily gifts find themselves adding breaths, especially as they move into or out of postures.

{{<audio src="/audio/tola.m4a" span="3" title="Pronunciation">}}

This amounts to only 12 grams more or less, so perhaps the idea was to make a joke for beginning practitioners.  When BNS Iyengar started recommedning that practitioners perform *bhastrika* breathing while in this posture, he began to refer to it as *utpluthiḥ*, "jumping up".

Entering vinyāsa:

1. inhale:  releasing hands from mudrā, place them on the floor palms beside hips and lift off the floor
