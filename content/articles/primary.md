This article lists the postures of the Primary Series as taught by BNS Iyengar, along with a rendering of the encompassing vinyāsa.[^vinyasa] The postures are identified first in Sanskrit and then in English translation, with audio clips for pronunciation and miscellaneous notes.  For best results, please review the article on <a href="/articles/sanskrit-vocabulary/">basic terms</a>.

[^vinyasa]: The term *vinyāsa* is often used loosely to refer to the sequence of movments that form a transition from one seated posture to the next---liftng up, jumping/stepping back to plank, up-dog, down-down, jump/step through to a sitting position to begin the next posture---but here it is used in its strict sense as one-half of a breath (either the inhale or the exhale) that is to be associated with a particular movement between postures as opposed to breaths taken while in the postures themselves.

    Both the loose and strict sense of the term appear to have been introduced in the 20th century, probably by Tirumalai Kṛśṇamācharya, the developer of Aṣṭāṅga Yoga.  See <a href="https://www.theluminescent.org/2016/07/vinyasa-medieval-and-modern-meanings.html" target="_blank">this article</a> for more information on the term.]

It is important to bear in mind that, just as the postures themselves should be modified to individual bodies and needs, so the encompassing vinyāsa count should treated as aspirational only and should be subject to adjustment.  Even experienced persons who come to the practice with considerable bodily gifts find themselves adding breaths, especially as they move into or out of postures.
