Trident Moon promotes the practice of Aṣṭāṅga Yoga and meditation in Central Kentucky.  It is a labor of love, the fruit of decades of study of the postural dimension of Yoga and its original larger context, namely: the classical Indian philosophical, religious and meditative traditions within which Yoga has been variously cultivated.

If Yoga were only a system for physical health that leads to happiness in one's body, that would be marvellous enough, but experience shows that through the disciplined and unassuming practice of Yoga one is also opened, over time, to encounter with the Mystery of God, in whom we all live, move and have our being.

This site is very much still under construction.  Students can find links to posture cheat-sheets <a href="articles/01-sheets/">here</a> and I try to keep the <a href="classes/index.html">class schedule</a> up to date, but consider following Trident Moon on social media for the most current news.
