## Pavilion Classes


### Aṣṭāṅga Yoga

Meeting Times:

* Mondays and Wednesdays, 10-11:30am.

This class presumes familiarity with Sun Salutations and the fundamental standing postures, such as might be acquired by attending the introductory class 2-3 times.  Content varies:  sometimes we focus on Primary Series through about Nāvāsana, sometmes on Second Series through the backbends, but usually we follow up with a focused study of a selected theme such as hip-opening or inversions. The class runs 90 minutes, but folks who are pressed for time (or decide they have had enough) should feel free to leave early.

#### Note for Beginners

Complete beginners are welcome! Try to arrive on time or even a little bit early, though, so I can arrange to take you aside for the first half-hour or so to introduce you to the basic themes of the Yoga and to its fundamental opening postures.  After that we'll rejoin the class and you can follow along as much as you like.
