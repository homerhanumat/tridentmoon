## Pavilion Classes

### Introduction to Aṣṭāṅga Yoga

Anyone can join this class at any time.  We go slow enough that newcomers can learn the Sun Salutations and experience a few of the fundamental standing postures.

Meeting Times:

* Fridays, 10-11am.  (**Note**:  No class on October 4 or October 11, as I must be out of town on those days.)


### Aṣṭāṅga Yoga Primary Series

Meeting Times:

* Mondays and Wednesdays, 10-11:30am

This class presumes familiarity with Sun Salutations and the fundamental standing postures, such as might be acquired by attending the introductory class 2-3 times.  Our aim in this class is to gradually introduce the postures of the Primary Series.  People who are pressed for time (or decide they have had enough) should feel free to leave early.

### Location and Pricing

All classes are at <a href="https://gscparks.com/facilities/the-pavilion/" target="_blank">The Pavilion</a> in Georgetown, KY.

The Pavilion is run by Georgetown/Scott County Parks and Recreation.  Classes are free for Pavilion members.  For non-members the rates for a day-pass are:

* $8 (adultScott County resident)
* $10 (adult non-resident)
* $4 (Georgetown College student)

## Sole Collective Classes

The new <a href="https://www.instagram.com/solecollective.studio/" target="_blank">Sole Collective</a> is conveniently located in downtown Georgetown.  Currently my schedule there is:

* Thursdays, 5:30-7:00pm.

I'll accomodate people who are new to Aṣṭāṅga, but the aim will be to move people quickly into guided Primary Series.

Book classes on the Sole Collective website.  The price for a drop-in class is $20, and unlimited membership is $125 per month ($55 for the first month).
