## Pavilion Classes

### Introduction to Aṣṭāṅga Yoga

Anyone can join this class at any time.  We go slow enough that newcomers can learn the Sun Salutations, experience a few of the fundamental standing postures, and get a taste of things to come.

Meeting Times:

* Fridays, 10-11am.  (**Note**:  No class on December 20 and December 27.)


### Aṣṭāṅga Yoga

Meeting Times:

* Mondays and Wednesdays, 10-11:30am.  ((**Note**:  No class on December 16 and December 18.))

This class presumes familiarity with Sun Salutations and the fundamental standing postures, such as might be acquired by attending the introductory class 2-3 times.  We had got into a pattern of doing Primary Series through Nāvāsana, then work-shopping selected subsequent postures, but lately we have also been developing an accessible version of Second Series so people can experience more back-bending.  The class runs 90 minutes, but folks who are pressed for time (or decide they have had enough) should feel free to leave early.
